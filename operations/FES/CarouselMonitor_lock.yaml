title: CarouselMonitor_lock
description: The carousel maintain the LSSTcam  filters out of the beam and present the selected filter to be installed on the focal plane to the AutoChanger. When a filter is put back in the carousel, its pins ( one in X- , one in X+)  are locked by the carousel clamps. These plots presents various plots related to this operation. The pin locking inside the clamps is a passive action from the carousel point of view ( the clamps close by themself under the AC presure inside the clamps). Still there is 2 probes in the carousel clamp that record the clamping operation. The filter presence probes , which indicate the position of the filter inside the clamp ( it's a proximity sensor , smaller is the value deeper the filter pin in the clamp ). The lock sensors, which indicate how much the clamp is closed ( larger it is , more the lock is closed ).
