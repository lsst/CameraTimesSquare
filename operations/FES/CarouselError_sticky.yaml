description: The carousel maintain the LSSTcam  filters out of the beam and present the selected filter to be installed on the focal plane to the AutoChanger. When not used for some time ( ~10 hours and more),it mays fail to start its movement. This generate a set of caracteristic errors in the carousel controler ( Auxiliary Sensor Direction Error,  Overcurrent Error,  Following Error). This notebook aims to find this type of error in the database , and through the production of a plot, it can confirm or not that a carousel error at a given time is of the "sticky" type . To recover such error requests nothing else than clearing the FES error, setting the camera back under the observatory control and  and to re-execute the filter exchange requested.
